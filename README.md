# Project: An Analysis to find Social Buzz's Top 5 most popular categories of content
## Project Overview
Completed a project as part of the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation, utilizing Excel for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization tasks. The project focuses on transforming raw data into actionable insights, presenting results through effective storytelling techniques for a client-focused presentation.

**Project Background**: To give context, Social Buzz platform receives over 100000 posts per day which amounts to 36 500 000 posts every year, of which, this is all unstructured data making it very hard to make sense of. In this day and age, content is king. But how to capitalize on it when there is so much?

### Data Sources
There were 3 primary datasets used for this analysis,namely: "Content.csv" file, "Reactions.csv" file and "Reaction Types.csv" file. Each contained detailed and relevant information about the content generated by the client's platform.  

### Tools
- Excel - Data cleaning, Data Analysis,& data visualization
- Power Point - creating the presentation

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and Inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Handling duplicates
4. Data formatting
   
### Data Modelling
- Using a **data model**, I identified which datasets would be required to answer the client's business question. (A **data model**, shows the relationships between all of the datasets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables).
- **Reaction** table was used as the base table, then proceeded to join the relevant columns from the **"Content dataset"** & **"Reaction Types dataset"** using **VLookUp** formula.
- The end result was one spreadsheet containing a new cleaned dataset that was used for the analysis. This new dataset is named "Clean dataset.csv".

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the dataset to answer key questions such as:
- what were the top 5 most popular content categories?
- How many unique categories are there?
- How many reactions are there for each content category?

### Data Analysis
Excel was used for the data analysis.

### Results/ Findings
From the data I found that there was a total of 16 unique categories of posts across the sample dataset. This includes things such as Food, Science and Animals.
As well as this, there were 1897 reactions from just the animal category alone! People obviously really like animals!
And also the most common month for users to post within was January. This aligns with seasonal trends of social media users that feel the need to reconnect with people after calendar events such as Christmas.
But now, onto the main question that the analysis sought to answer... which is... what were the top 5 most popular categories of posts?

From the analysis, it was evident that the top 5 most popular categories of posts were animals, science, healthy eating, technology and food in descending order.
Animals had an aggregate popularity score of around 74965. It is very interesting to see both food and healthy eating within the top 5, it really shows that food is a highly engaging content category. Healthy eating ranks slightly higher than food, so perhaps your user base may be skewed towards healthy eaters and health-conscious people.
Finally, its also interesting to see science and technology too. This may suggest that people enjoy consuming factual content and snippets of content that they can learn something from.

### Recommendations
1. To avoid an issue where 1 content category consumes the entireplatform, it will be important for you to ensure that any algorithms used to govern the content on the platform gives a fair balance to the content categories.
2. Food was a common theme amongst popular content and the most popular food category was healthy eating. This could be a signal to show the types of people that are using your platform, and you could use this insight to boost engagement even further. For example, you could run a campaign with content focused on this category or work with healthy eating brands to promote content.
